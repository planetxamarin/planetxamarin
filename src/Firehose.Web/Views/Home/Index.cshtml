<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
    Hi, and welcome to The Firehose!
</p>
<p>
    The Firehose is an opt-in aggregation of all of <a href="http://www.readify.net/">Readify</a>'s bloggers. By subscribing to one convenient RSS feed, you can see all
    of the content generated by all of Readify in your news reader.
</p>
<h1>
    Where's the feed? Where's the feed?!
</h1>
<p>
    Either:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Point your RSS reader at this page and it'll find it; or
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="@(Url.UrlFor<FeedController>(c => c.Rss(50)))">Subscribe to the feed manually.</a>
        </li>
    </ol>
    Just point your RSS reader at this page and it'll find it.
</p>
<h1>Can I just read it here?</h1>
<p>
    You can, but we don't want to redirect traffic from our people's individual sites. Here's a
    <a href="@(Url.UrlFor<FeedController>(c => c.Read(25)))">sneak peek</a> in case you're still trying to decide
    to subscribe.
</p>
<h1>Who are you all?</h1>
<p>
    We're consultants and other people who work at Readify. You can <a href="@(Url.UrlFor<WhoAreWeController>(c => c.Readifarians()))">read more about us here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Authors' opinions</h2>
<p>
    At Readify, we pride ourselves on diversity of thought - our strength is in our unique collective viewpoints and experiences. 
    We love sharing this diversity with the community, and we don't censor or curate these blogs - they represent the authors' opinions, not Readify's.
