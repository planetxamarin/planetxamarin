<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
    Hi, and welcome to Xamarin Planet!
</p>
<p>
    Xamarin Planet is an aggregation of all the Xamarin Community blogs. You can subscribe to one convenient RSS feed, 
    to see all the content generated by the community members in you news reader.
</p>
<h1>
    Where's the feed? Where's the feed?!
</h1>
<p>
    Either:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Point your RSS reader at this page and it'll find it; or
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="@(Url.UrlFor<FeedController>(c => c.Rss(50)))">Subscribe to the feed manually.</a>
        </li>
    </ol>
    Just point your RSS reader at this page and it'll find it.
</p>
<h1>Can I just read it here?</h1>
<p>
    You can, but we don't want to redirect traffic from our people's individual sites. Here's a
    <a href="@(Url.UrlFor<FeedController>(c => c.Read(25)))">sneak peek</a> in case you're still trying to decide
    to subscribe.
</p>
<h1>Who are you all?</h1>
<p>
    We are community members! You can <a href="@(Url.UrlFor<WhoAreWeController>(c => c.Members()))">read more about us here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Authors' opinions</h2>
<p>
    At Readify, we pride ourselves on diversity of thought - our strength is in our unique collective viewpoints and experiences. 
    We love sharing this diversity with the community, and we don't censor or curate these blogs - they represent the authors' opinions, not Readify's.
